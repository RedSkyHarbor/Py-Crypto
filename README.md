# Py-Crypto: A playground for me to combine crpytographic primitives


* **Py-Crypto** 
  - Created using the python library 'cryptography'
    - "cryptography includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests, and key derivation functions. " 
    - More here : https://cryptography.io/en/latest/

* **Overview**
  - Not sure yet. Gonna start messing with this library soon!
  - Provided as is under MIT license, as in you should not use my code where security actually matters.

* **Project Goals**
  - performance, fun, expressiveness?
