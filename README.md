# Py-Crypto:
 
* **Overview**
  - Provided as is under MIT license, as in you should not use my code where security actually matters.

* **Project Goals**
  - To apply my knowledge of cryptography to create new (or reimagined ) implementations of secure encryption schemes.
  - performance, fun, expressiveness?
 
* **Project Details**
  - Built using cryptographic primitives provided by the python library cryptography
    - "includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms...is broadly divided into two levels: One with safe cryptographic recipes that require little to no configuration choices...The other is low-level cryptographic primitives. These are often dangerous and can be used incorrectly."
